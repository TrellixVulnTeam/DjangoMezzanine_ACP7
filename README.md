# DjangoMezzanine

Mezzanine is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management platform. Built using the Django framework, 
Mezzanine provides a simple yet highly extensible     architecture that encourages diving in and hacking on the code.
Mezzanine resembles tools such as Wordpress, providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog     posts, form data, 
store products, and other types of content.
Mezzanine provides most of its functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient     platform.
